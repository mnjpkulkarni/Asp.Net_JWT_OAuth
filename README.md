# Asp.Net_JWT_OAuth
This Asp.Net project demonstrates the usage of JWT(JSON Web Token) to Authenticate and Authorize the users and provide access to the Resource APIs.

Instructions
1. I have hard-coded the username and password as this project involves no Database.
2. You can run this project in the localhost.
3. obtain the access token by hitting the endpoint "/api/token" along with sending a form JSON body with username as "manoj" and password as "password".
4. You need to send this token by adding it to the header as Bearer token and hit the endpoint "/api/cricketers" to obtain the data.
